Docker Image: Ubuntu (stable) + Rust (nightly)
==============================================

This repo contains a Concourse CI pipeline to build a docker image based on
Ubuntu (latest stable release) nightly. The image contains nothing more than
`rustc` and `cargo` for building Rust-based binaries and libraries.
